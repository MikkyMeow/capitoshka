00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.191
This is my house.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.999
It's not big, and it's not small.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.000
But I like it.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.432
Three people live here.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:45.889
This is Matt.

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:47.504
Hi. I'm Matt.

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:49.895
This is David.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:51.940
Hello. My name's David.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.666
And that's me. Hi, Helen. Pleased to meet you.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:57.667
So, there are three people.

00:00:57.668 --> 00:00:59.800
But there are four bedrooms.

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:01.771
So today is interview day.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.597
What's your job?

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:08.522
I'm a jazz musician.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:00:70.333
Really? What do you play?

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:11.822
The drums.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.687
But he's very quiet ... and friendly.

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:34.523
No dogs?

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:38.999
Sorry.

00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:50.995
One hundred and fifty pounds a month? Great!

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:53.711
Er, no.

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:56.700
One hundred and fifty pounds a week.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.485
Sorry.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.366
Where are you from?

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:06.974
Edinburgh. But my job's in Oxford.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.500
Good.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.909
This is a nice house.

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:12.062
Thanks. We're happy here.

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:14.610
OK?

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:18.527
- OK, Anne... - Cigarette?

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:27.611
I don't smoke. We don't smoke, do we?

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:30.226
Er ... No.

00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:32.205
We don't smoke!

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:33.735
Oh.

00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:36.272
Sorry.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.952
This is terrible.

00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:47.925
Who's next?

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:53.666
Her name's Jane. She's number eight. She's the last.

00:02:15.242 --> 00:02:17.155
So, Jane, tell us about yourself.

00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:19.214
Tell you what?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.065
Anything.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.413
I'm from Brighton. I'm a drama teacher.

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:32.758
I don't smoke. I like films. Goodfood.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:32.592
Goodfood?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:39.195
Yeah. Italian, French, Chinese.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:40.707
Do you cook?

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:43.832
Yes. I'm a very good cook.

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.316
Do you have a dog?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.848
No.

00:02:50.423 --> 00:02:51.635
- A cat? - No.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.453
No animals?

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.339
Do you play the drums?

00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:00.330
No.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:04.374
Trombone, violin, saxophone?

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.184
Nothing.

00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:15.464
That's great, Jane. It's your room.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.632
Fantastic!

00:03:18.794 --> 00:03:19.643
When can you move in?

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:62.220
- Next week? - This week?

00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:25.543
- Tomorrow? - Sure.

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:29.763
Welcome to 53 Blackwood Road.

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:32.287
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:38.833
So now there are four of us.
